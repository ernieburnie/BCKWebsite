What exactly is the Reality in Mirage? Mirage represents the ideas that are commonly held by the majority that do fail to possess any real justification or substantiation; on the other hand, reality represents what lies under common and popular beliefs that are founded on experience. Thus, our theme for the event, Reality in Mirage, symbolizes an integration of the two ideas, forming the unveiling of hidden truths behind an idea or notion that is widely perceived. It calls for a reformation, a renewal of one’s mind, to truly reconsider our current system of ideas and to apply a deeper understandings of these notions. Come with an open mind and prepare to walk out with a brand new view on society, the world, and yourself. </p> <hr/> <h2>Speakers</h2> <section id="speakers"> <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Campbell_Chang_500px.jpg" alt=""/></span><h3>Campbell Chang</h3>Campbell Chang is a Taiwanese American who immigrated to the United States at the young age of 4.
